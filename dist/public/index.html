                                    Jordan boasts almost year-round sunshine with temperate, comfortable weather.
                                    Spring and autumn are fresh and crisp with rain being more common in the spring.
                                    This is when the wildflowers bloom and the fields are full. The long summer days
                                    are sunny with cool evenings – perfect for rooftop sunsets and outdoor activities.
                                    Wintertime can be cold in the desert, but is pleasantly moderate in most of the
                                    country. This is an especially good time for a trip to Aqaba or the Dead Sea where
                                    temperatures are warmer. Any time of the year is a perfect time to visit Jordan.

                        Rich Jordanian food coupled with famous Jordanian hospitality creates an atmosphere of
                        festivities
                        each
                        time a meal is served. Feasting is a preoccupation not only of Jordan, but of the Middle East
                        as a
                        whole. Mealtime in Jordan is not merely a biological function, but rather a social event.
                        Jordanians
                        are generally grouped during mealtime and are presented with food in a collective manner.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Food is a very important aspect within the Jordanian culture. In most villages, meals are a
                        community
                        event with the immediate and extended family present. In addition, food is commonly used by
                        Jordanians
                        to express their hospitality and generosity. Jordanians by nature are very hospital people and,
                        often,
                        it is presented within minutes of a person's invitation to a local house.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is with pride that Jordanians serve family, friends, and guests in their homes; no matter
                        how
                        modest their means. A 'Jordanian invitation' means that you are expected to bring nothing and
                        eat
                        everything. This
                        invitation is followed by the popular Arabic phrase “Sahtain wa 'Afiya.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Of course, when we discuss Jordanian food, we have to mention- at length- the most distinctive
                        Jordanian dish, Mansaf.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mansaf is the national dish of Jordan which often symbolizes an occasion. It consists of Arabic
                        rice, a
                        rich broth made from dry sour milk (jameed), and either lamb or chicken. Whether Jordanians are
                        celebrating a graduation, an engagement, or a wedding, Mansaf is commonly served. In addition,
                        Mansaf
                        is also served during condolences and as a means to patch up ties with others. Feasting on
                        Mansaf
                        is
                        taken seriously, and hours are spent in its preparations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mansaf on the menu is the greatest symbol in Jordanian culture for generosity. The level of
                        generosity
                        is determined by the amount of lamb presented. Utensils are not commonly used when eating
                        Mansaf.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Guests feast from the communal dish using their hands, due to the fact that it symbolizes a
                        social
                        community gathering. The grand presentation is placed in the middle of the dining setting.

                                Amman, the capital of Jordan, is a fascinating city of contrasts – a unique blend of
                                old and new, ideally situated on a hilly area between the desert and the fertile Jordan
                                Valley.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the commercial heart of the city, ultra-modern buildings, hotels, smart restaurants,
                                art galleries and boutiques rub shoulders comfortably with traditional coffee shops and
                                tiny artisans' workshops. Everywhere there is evidence of the city's much older past.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Due to the city's modern-day prosperity and temperate climate, almost half of Jordan's
                                population is concentrated in the Amman area. The residential suburbs consist of mainly
                                tree-lined streets and avenues flanked by elegant, almost uniformly white houses in
                                accordance with a municipal law, which states that all buildings must be faced with

                                The downtown area is much older and more traditional with smaller businesses producing

                            <p>
                                A close second to Petra on the list of favourite destinations in Jordan is the ancient
                                city of Jerash, which boasts an unbroken chain of human occupation dating back more
                                than 6,500 years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jerash lies on a plain surrounded by hilly wooded areas and fertile basins. Conquered
                                by General Pompey in 63 BC, it came under Roman rule and was one of the ten great Roman
                                cities of the Decapolis League.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The city's golden age came under Roman rule, during which time it was known as Gerasa,
                                and the site is now generally acknowledged to be one of the best-preserved Roman
                                provincial towns in the world. Hidden for centuries in sand before being excavated and
                                restored over the past 70 years, Jerash reveals a fine example of the grand, formal
                                provincial Roman urbanism that is found throughout the Middle East, comprising paved
                                and colonnaded streets, soaring hilltop temples, handsome theatres, spacious public
                                squares and plazas, baths, fountains and city walls pierced by towers and gates.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beneath its external Graeco - Roman veneer, Jerash also preserves a subtle blend of
                                east and west. Its architecture, religion and languages reflect a process by which two
                                powerful cultures meshed and coexisted - The Graeco-Roman world of the Mediterranean
                                basin and the traditions of the Arab Orient.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The modern city of Jerash can be found to the east of the ruins. While the old and new
                                share a city wall, careful preservation and planning has seen the city itself develop
                                well away from the ruins so there is no encroachment on the sites of old.

                            <p>
                                The giant red mountains and vast mausoleums of a departed race have nothing in common
                                with modern civilization, and ask nothing of it except to be appreciated at their true
                                value - as one of the greatest wonders ever wrought by Nature and Man.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although much has been written about Petra, nothing really prepares you for this
                                amazing place. It has to be seen to be believed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Petra, the world wonder, is without a doubt Jordan's most valuable treasure and
                                greatest tourist attraction. It is a vast, unique city, carved into the sheer rock face
                                by the Nabataeans, an industrious Arab people who settled here more than 2000 years
                                ago, turning it into an important junction for the silk, spice and other trade routes
                                that linked China, India and southern Arabia with Egypt, Syria, Greece and Rome.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Entrance to the city is through the Siq, a narrow gorge, over 1km in length, which is
                                flanked on either side by soaring, 80m high cliffs. Just walking through the Siq is an
                                experience in itself. The colours and formations of the rocks are dazzling. As you
                                reach the end of the Siq you will catch your first glimpse of Al-Khazneh (Treasury).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is an awe-inspiring experience. A massive façade, 30m wide and 43m high, carved
                                out of the sheer, dusky pink rock-face and dwarfing everything around it. It was carved
                                in the early 1st century as the tomb of an important Nabataean king and represents the
                                engineering genius of these ancient people.
